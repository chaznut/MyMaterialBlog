# \    Hello and welcome!

Thank you so much for stopping by my blog! I have created this blog to document my journey of being a self-taught developer. I've been coding for over a year now but have only been using HTML, CSS, JS/React for around 7 months. Everything that I had learned and used prior was Python with the very basics of Java. I found myself loving the visual feedback the front end gave me from my code and quickly became obsessed with load times and clean code. I am a long way away from being a great or even a decent programmer but I am hoping this blog helps me retain my studies. I plan on blogging about not only what I'm learning but also what I am doing currently in code. I think I may sprinkle some of my personal events/interests as well. Outside of coding I have plenty of other interests and hobbies. I am currently a two stripe white belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and am going to be competing more often once 2019 rolls around. I love PC gaming and also love pretty much any card game I can get my hands on. I have a fiance that I love dearly and two cats that I consider my children. My favorite thing in the world is relaxing at my computer early in the morning with a hot cup of coffee and catching up on the hot news in programming which I am almost certain makes me a very lame human being. 

That's all for my introduction! My next post will be about my current side project I am working on that I am very pumped up about! Talk to you then!
