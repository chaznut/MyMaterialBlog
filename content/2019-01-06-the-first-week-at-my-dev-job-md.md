# We finally made it.

After what felt like a million years, my start date was upon me. My sleep schedule was horrendous through the holidays and it led to me getting a cool 3 hours of sleep before my first day. I had the typical first day nerves the night before my first day but I also felt some extra tension. This is something I have been working a long time to obtain and it was staring me in the face. A sense of completion came over me when I had received the offer for this job, almost like the long journey had reached its climax. In reality it was only the end of a chapter and the new chapter was about to begin for me. 



There are a lot of differences when it comes to my last job and the one I have just started. The most obvious difference is the fact that instead of an IT troubleshooting role I am now a full stack developer. I don't think I need to spell out all of those for you so I will move onto the lesser known details. My IT job was not the worst job I have had by any stretch of the imagination, and I have to say had the best work place coffee bar of all time (Seriously, it was _tremendous_). However with that said it was a smaller company that had a tendency to stretch the workers about as far as they could and at times it felt like there was very little work/life balance. On top of that the schedules were something that were pretty unfavorable with points of contention for requested days off. Every day I would come home to think "Only x amount of days until my next day off". 

This new job though, oh my, has changed everything. It is in walking distance of my house, you create your own hours within a certain time frame, and there's even catered lunch! Those are all great benefits and the amount of work/life balance this provides me is priceless. The work environment is very laid back, probably as laid back as you can get but still has a strong feeling that a lot is being accomplished every day. Everyone has been very kind and extended their help if at any point I would need it, it makes me feel like the company really wants to see me succeed. There is one big thing I did not really consider however that I immediately noticed the night after my first day of work. I have _**SO**_ much more free time now that I am coding during the day at my job. I no longer feel guilty if I don't put in countless hours every evening learning more code. I have time to really unwind and ease my mind. Now don't get it twisted folks, I am still going to be doing self improvement and tons of learning on my own. Coding in my free time is something I love or else I would have never started this journey in the first place. Sometimes though it does feel good to just step away and turn off the brain for a while!

Basically this job is providing me all the positives I thought it would and more. My dreams have come true! My first day was spent meeting everyone, setting up my new computer, and pondering what I wanted to work on for my on-boarding project. My on-boarding project is essentially just building any application I want with the MERN stack while also using the DevOps flow of the company. Like honestly, how amazing is that? I dove right in and spent the rest of the week working with the front end of my project in React. Starting this week I plan on bringing in React-Vis from Uber to do some data visualization, something I have never done before! I plan on sharing my project once it is complete which should take around 3 months!



So really I guess this post is more of a reflection that all I have been working for has paid off and it's just as great as I imagined it. I'll be posting part two of how I got to this point soon enough. I am seriously considering going to a video format of blogging from here on out because I find typing out all of my thoughts to be very, very long winded. Let me know on twitter what you think!
