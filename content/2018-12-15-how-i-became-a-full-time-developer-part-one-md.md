I am excited to announce I have accepted my first full-time developer position with a company in Columbia, Maryland. While it is the first offer I have _accepted _it was not my first _offer _for a full-time spot. The journey to this point was not an easy one and at times was more defeating than rewarding. However I can say with confidence this is one of the best moments of my life. I have struggled to think of a way to structure this story and for that reason have held out on posting it. I have come to the conclusion that breaking this up into a timeline/parts is the best way to get through it all. I will be authoring multiple blog posts documenting the path that lead me to becoming employed as a self-taught developer and this is part one. Let us begin!

# The First Month or Two.

## `Hello (Coding) World!`

It was just about 10 months ago when i decided I wanted to dive deep into the world of front-end web development and more specifically Javascript. I had played around with websites and Java in high school but never on any level beyond copying/pasting. I also briefly leveraged Python to automate some of my workflow at an IT job. I had really enjoyed learning Python but was elementary in my understanding and to be honest couldn't figure out what I wanted to do with the language that would interest me. I began filtering through indeed.com postings for coding jobs and noticed that on almost every single application there was a requirement for Javascript. Now as someone who had pondered what language to learn I had always read to first learn Python and stay away from Javascript because it was a "bad" language. What that meant? I have literally no idea but I read it on the internet so it must be true! Going against all the advice I read from various internet forums I began to look into what Javascript could create for me. I was fascinated, not only were websites interactive because of Javascript but there was a framework I kept reading about called React that seemed to have favorable reviews everywhere. I decided that between the hype around React and the amount of jobs for junior web developers floating around that Javascript was the language to learn. I read an article by Andrei Neagoie about how to become a self-taught web developer and it just so happened he had released a course to go a long with it. I decided I would take his course on Udemy along with Free Code Camp. These two tools were essential in exposing me to the various tools and options in the front end realm and even though I had to branch out and learn more than just what they provided I believe firmly they were the best building blocks available. I would definitely recommend these two resources to every single person who wants to get into coding!

Part two coming soon!

**Resources mentioned**

[Free Code Camp](www.freecodecamp.com) website where you can learn coding online and check out there amazing community in the forums.

[Andrei Neagoie's course(s)](https://www.udemy.com/user/andrei-neagoie/) - I began my journey with Andrei's [The Complete Web Developer in 2018: Zero to Mastery course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) and since then I have taken all of his other courses as well. He keeps them all up to date and even recently updated the mastery course above to be relevant going into 2019!
