# Imposter Syndrome be damned, I'm a freelance developer.

As I have learned how to code and planned my future I have always had an ideal scenario in the back of my mind. I have always thought I would work for a company 9-5 for five to seven years as a developer and then I could start freelancing. Along with freelancing, by that time I should be close to a brown or black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu so my other job would ideally be teaching BJJ classes to the youth.  Essentially my dream is to do what I love (coding and BJJ) and become my own boss. All of that got thrown out of whack when I was contacted via LinkedIn message. I received that message from a marketing director working at a local start up company that was in need for a web developer. Specifically they needed someone to remove the bottleneck from their marketing campaign projects by creating landing page templates and email templates. Landing pages? I love making landing pages! Email templates? I have some slight experience, definitely not my favorite thing to do but I can accomplish that! I interviewed the next day and was hired as a freelance developer, and I even got a sweet t shirt! (Seriously the company's logo is amazing, it's a cat in a rocketship!).

## _Then self-doubt came a knocking..._

Was I _really_ qualified? Do I even know what I am doing!? All of the typical imposter syndrome questions leaked into my brain and I was beginning to feel like I had bitten off more than I could chew. Thankfully I am here to tell you that none of that was true. Not only was I able to create some beautiful landing pages but I also learned how to create HTML emails. Now I would be lying if I said it was all gravy and nothing went wrong. There were some long nights and the system they were using for templating (Pardot from Salesforce) was a nightmare. I definitely do **NOT** recommend ever taking a job where Pardot is one of the main systems you will work through. At the end of 8 weeks the company decided they had enough material from me to start some campaigns and hopefully will use me again in the future. They are now seeking out a Pardot specialist to finish up some of the templating capabilities and everyone is happy. I have now marked off one of my biggest goals in my career: landing a great freelance job! I hope more opportunities present themself to me in the future, I will be waiting and ready for it!
