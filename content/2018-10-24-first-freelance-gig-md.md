# Imposter Syndrome be damned, I'm a freelance developer.

As I have learned how to code and planned my future I have always had an ideal scenario in the back of my mind. I have always thought I would work for a company 9-5 for five to seven years as a developer and then I could start freelancing. Along with freelancing, by that time I should be close to a brown or black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu so my other job would ideally be teaching BJJ classes to the youth.  Essentially my dream is to do what I love (coding and BJJ) and become my own boss. All of that got thrown out of whack last week when I was contacted via LinkedIn message. I received that message from a gentlemen working at a local start up company that was in need for a web developer. Specifically they needed someone to remove the bottleneck from their marketing campaign projects by creating landing page templates and email templates. Landing pages? I love making landing pages! Email templates? I have some slight experience, definitely not my favorite thing to do but I can accomplish that! I interviewed the next day and was hired as a freelance developer, and I even got a sweet t shirt! (Seriously the companies logo is amazing, it's a cat in a rocketship!).

## Then self doubt came a knocking...
